# Problem 2

*A single observation can influence the sample mean arbitrarily.*

# Example:

Let $x$ be a vector of $n$ observation and let $\bar{x}$ be the sample mean of $x$. By changing a single observation in $x$ it is possible to change $\bar{x}$ to any value. In the jargon of robust statistics, the sample mean has a *break down point* of 0, $\bar{x}$ can be made arbitrarily large by changing a single observation in $x$. This means that the sample mean can be a misleading measure of central tendency when a data set is contaminated by outliers. The median, on the other hand, is more robust and has a break down point of 0.5, you would need to change 50% of the observations in $x$ to make the sample median arbitrarily large.

Figure **mean/001/001** shows how the sample mean is successively pulled away from the bulk of the observations by perturbing just one data point. This can be compared with the sample median which is not affected at all.
